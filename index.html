    <h3>The Stranger Didn't Know</h3>
    <hr>
    <h5>
      The Stranger didn't know...<br>
He lived in a rock<br>
With eyes wide open<br>
Yet very little thought<br>
Of what is around<br>
And which one to sort.<br>
The inside or the picture<br>
In front of the dazing eyes<br>
With a sense of wonder<br>
A little truth, And so many lies.<br>
The Stranger didn't know...<br>
So he threw a rock<br>
What looked like a lump<br>
Turned into a croc.<br>
He has to swim<br>
Without any fins <br>
Felt like in a cage<br>
With tired old wings.<br>
The Stranger didn't know...<br>
So for freedom he screamed<br>
Raging why he can't<br>
Till he noticed a shadow<br>
Of another like him, burnt.<br>
There's neither pain or joy<br>
Just like a passing thought<br>
A glimpse of all that's there<br>
And what could be lost.<br>
The dead doesn't talk<br>
Even when lighting strikes<br>
So he felt alive, breathing<br>
More than his would have liked.<br>
He sat on the land<br>
Under the starry night's glow<br>
The Stranger knew there are things<br>
More than he would ever know.<br>
